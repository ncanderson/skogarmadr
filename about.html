            <h4 class="skogardef">noun</h4>
        <p class="skogardef">Literally "man of the forest". In medieval Iceland, refers to an outlaw of the fullest degree, excluded from society, forced to live out in the forests and wilderness, alone.</p>

            <p class="skogardef">This website is in the care and keeping of Peter Anderson. Born and raised in West Michigan, Peter is shockingly not Dutch, and thinks there are many better flowers than tulips. He has been drawing and making other art since his earliest memories, and as the son of a carpenter, metalworker, and technical director at a theater,<sup>1</sup> grew up around lots of lumber, power tools, and theater people, which probably explains a lot.</p>
            <br/>
            <p class="skogardef"><sup><sup>1</sup>To clarify, this is the same person, not three separate parents.</sup></p>
            <p class="skogardef">Peter is currently pursuing an art major in college, and has a focus on drawing (with both traditional and digital mediums) and painting (primarily digital but with experience in acrylics and pastel) in an illustrative style, and although he has shown capability in the meanings and thought processes of "high" or "conceptual art," is currently seeking work in illustration or concept art (primarily for the film or gaming industries).</p>
            <p class="skogardef">With a background in carpentry and woodwork, particularly for theater, Peter is also a skilled and capable builder with an artistic flair.</p>
            <p class="skogardef">This site includes a <a href="/gallery.html">gallery</a> portfolio with sections devoted to each of these various skills, with examples of 2D media (in the sections Drawings, Paintings, and Digital Work), built objects (sections Sculpture, Scenery, and Props), and photography (under the section Cinemagraphic Stills. Just kidding, it's in Photography). A <a href="/portfolio.html">streamlined</a> view is also available&mdash; think of it as a highlight reel of Peter's best work.</p>
